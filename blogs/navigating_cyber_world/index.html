        <h2 class="heading section-title">Applications</h2>
        <p class="para">
            Applications run on your system everyday. You’re running an application right now- Zoom (or
            you’re on a browser, which also is an app!).
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Some code, a server where data is stored, and some network is responsible for the app or program to run.
            The code is responsible for relaying information like texts, video feeds, and other sensitive information to
            the servers and to other people. Apps can handle casual jobs like texting your old friend, to sensitive
            tasks like managing your bank or handling your health insurance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading section-title">Some Applications in Use</h2>
        <img src="https://shoutoutsocial.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_ximLhnmu2slxMNlcdaWsTg.jpeg">
        <p class="para">
            For connecting with your friends, you may be using WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram. For video chatting, you
            may be using Teams or Zoom, or even Skype.
            <br>
            For posting in forum’s there’s Twitter or Reddit. Then to connect to public servers there’s Discord. You may
            also be using Netflix to watch your favorite seasonal shows, or Crunchyroll to stream other indie shows.
            You may use Twitch to watch livestreams or livestream yourself! To watch videos there’s YouTube. So many
            apps!
            <br>
            These are run by big corporations that hire hundreds of workers to keep improving the app while some of them
            work to keep the servers secure.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            These apps are big for a reason. They’re fast, free, quick, easy and everyone’s already on it. This keeps
            making the userbase bigger and bigger. They serve one purpose and make everyone’s life easier.
            For some, they’ve become an integral part of their lives that they can’t live without (especially during the
            pandemic).
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2: Data-->
        <h2 class="heading section-title">Huge Data means Huge Responsibilty</h2>
        <p class="para">
            If you ever read some Terms and Conditions, you may find that these apps collect some of your search history
            (within the app) to find what you like. They may use data from your public profile or even outsource
            information from Google to display advertisements.
            They may even customize or filter information to only show you what you like. This may prove to be
            convenient, but is this morally right?
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading section-title">Some Questions Regarding Data</h2>
        <p class="para">
            One big question you should be asking – why does this app I’m using to chat with my friends need to know my
            search history? Why does this video platform care about if I am interested in buying something random and
            show me adverts about it?
            <br>
            This is where the ethics come in. On one hand, you’re getting the platform to use, on the other hand, your
            data might be getting tracked (such as search and location and network usage etc.). Worst of all? You don’t
            even know what’s happening to that data. Is it being sold? Is it being monitored?
            In fact, selling some of your data is how big companies that provide free (as in free of cost) software make
            money. They sell it to some advertising agencies that display ads to you according to your tastes. Some
            other form may also be being sent to software improvement teams without your knowing.
        </p>
        <!-- Highlighted note-->
        <p class="bright-note">
            So, what do you think? Should this continue? If your data is important to you, wouldn't you like all control
            over how your data is being monitored?
        </p>
        <!-- Security section begins-->
        <h2 class="heading section-title">Security and Safety</h2>
        <p class="para">
            This also makes you think, if these apps keep getting bigger, what stops malicious people from stealing your
            personal data through servers? What keeps them from reading very personal chats with your friends or family?
            You’re completely right! Some people keep looking for loopholes or flaws in these apps and use them to gain
            unprivileged access to thousands of accounts. We need to keep looking out for these people and keep
            ourselves safe.
        </p>
        <img
            src="https://images.ctfassets.net/bdm7zitnfa4i/pDHYKU8WbVpNtIm6966t9/8f9f5a3135b3830ee3a193132e5e7ceb/hacker-at-night.jpg?w=1800&q=50">
        <p class="para">
            You also may have heard about Facebook database leak of 2018 where 500 Million users were compromised. This
            means that hackers were able to obtain all of the related personal information like contacts, chats,
            passwords from each account. This data was just made public last month by these malicious users. This keeps
            happening to all major companies from time to time.
            So, is Instagram, or Facebook, or your bank’s app really safe? Who’s checking the code? Who’s preventing a
            virus from stealing your data on the app’s server? The employees who are responsible for this may not have
            tested this, and sometimes the problem may be unfixable. Even if this is fixed, some users may have already
            been permanently affected.
        </p>
        <!-- Section about Open Source-->
        <h2 class="heading section-title">The Idea Of Open Source</h2>
        <p class="para">
            Open source refers to the idea of making all of your code publicly available for anyone and everyone to see.
            This may also include the additional feature of anyone, yes, even you, being able to contribute and write
            code for the program or app.
            <br>
            Common misconception with this is that everything gets released to the public. This is wrong. Your password,
            data, and everything else gets saved privately. Not even the developers can see it. The method of transfer
            and safety is open sourced, meaning security can be improved tenfold.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading section-title">But Hackers can exploit easily! Right?</h2>
        <p class="para">
            One major feature of open-source, that you might have already guessed, is collaboration. People look for
            vulnerabilities in the code and fix it themselves instead of waiting for a company to fix it for them. This
            reduces the risk of getting hacked by over 90%!
            <br>
            This is one of the cornerstones of this type of development. This is also why security and safety are the
            top priority of open source developers. They can’t hide any flaws in the systems and you know at all times
            what happens in the code.
            <br>
            Moreover, an open-source app rarely has any adverts or data collection, because if they did.. They would get
            harsh criticism and someone would just copy the code and remove the ads!
            <br>
            "Your data is yours, not mine."
        </p>
        <!-- Linux -->
        <h2 class="heading section-title">One Interesting Case: Linux</h2>
        <img src="https://afraaltayer.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/logo-linux.png"></img>
        <p class="para">
            On the foundations of open-source, lies an operating system just like Windows or MacOS called Linux. It is
            used everywhere, from supercomputers, to the Mars Rover (yes, its true), to headquarter servers, to your
            desktop, your Android phone (yes, its Linux) and even in a toaster or a fire alarm! Linux is used
            everywhere, and you don’t even know!
            <br>
            It is the leading operating system used at Google, and even Microsoft uses it in their own servers. But
            that’s not even the best part.
            <br>
            It is completely open source and free! Both, free as in free food, and free as in freedom.
            Meaning you can write code for it yourself and modify it the way you like it. There are no restrictions on
            it whatsoever. So you can make your own operating system! Many institutions make their own flavours of Linux
            for their own use! Isn’t it crazy to have control over your own data and apps rather than relying on
            strangers?
        </p>
        <p class="bright-note">
            So what do you think of this? Open-source keeps all your data private, while at the same time keeping the
            same convenience the major apps have.
            Linux, the operating system we looked at, is completely open-source. Rarely any viruses get developed for it
            and its by far the most advanced operating system there is.
